# Biography
Hi, I'm Jeremy.
I really like writing code and trying to figure out things that are definitely
beyond my skill level.
I pretty sure that's the best way that I learn because you may not know at the
outset what you need to know in order to accomplish your goal, but you're pretty
likely to learn it on the way.

For fun I like being outdoors, figuring out how to forage for food, playing
rpg's like Dungeons & Dragons and Savage Worlds, and playing terminal-mode
dungeon crawlers.
